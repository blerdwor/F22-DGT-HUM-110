# Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype

Belle Lerdworatawee | DGT HUM 110 | Fall 2022

## Overview
**Project:** 
> The purpose of this project is to help young adults learn about ocean sustainability and find ways that they can help protect marine life. From conducting interviews and field research, I learned that a sample of young adults in LA feel that climate change can be overwhelming, don’t think that helping out is convenient, and like social aspects. Hence, my design aims to address these concerns by providing an app that makes ocean sustainability welcoming and worthwhile. The key tasks that this supports are:
> 1. able to easily find relevant textual and non-textual information on news on topics relating to marine conservation
> 2. able to easily find ways to help out both in-person
> 3. able to easily find ways to help out not in-person

**Purpose of Interface Design:**
> The purpose of making this high-fidelity prototype is to allow users to visualize  features that I wanted to add to the Marine Conservation’s webpage in order to improve it. This prototype allows us to conduct primitive usability tests.

**Process:**  
> This prototype started with observations and ideas from user testing. Firstly, the design decisions were chosen from observed desires or problems expressed by young adults during field research and interviews. Afterwards, I created 2 user personas to map out the interactions that I wanted to create and what problems they would solve specifically. Then I made a low-fidelity prototype as well as the design kit for it. I tested both with other users to gain a general impression of if the flow made sense or not, and how aesthetic / accessible was my design. I had initially started with a web app; however I changed it to a mobile app. Hence, I needed to modify my low-fidelity prototype a bit and the design library. With this, I started building the frames for my high-fidelity prototype in Figma. Throughout the process and with feedback that I received, I changed one of the original tasks that I had planned as well as conducted research on what content I included in the prototype.

> I plan to conduct a cognitive walkthrough as well as continue to ask for feedback from users to be able to revise my app as best as possible. 

## Wireflows
Please note that these are simplified versions of the wireflow! I only included one example of each interaction to make the diagram simpler as many interactions are repeats. I included all unique types of interactions that users may have with the app. The diagram was too complicated and messy with every interaction mapped out since they were essentially the exact same flows.

:one: This is how the app starts off. You choose whether you want to learn about ocean conservation or if you want to dive right in and help out.

:two: If you choose to dive right in finding events, then you would be able to type in your zip code or city to search for local events. I wasn't able to simulate typing in Figma so on the prototype demonstration below, the search bar will automatically be filled with Westwood's zip code when you click on it. That then leads to a grid full of options for helping out. Hovering over an image will provide you with more information; clicking on the image will pull up an overlay with a url and a description of the event.

:three: Every "More Ways to Help" button leads to the same page. On this page, you can hover over each button to click on a link to an external petition or resource.

:four: If you choose to learn more about efforts in ocean conservation, it will show you 4 options. One of the options is just learning about statistics on pollution in the oceans. 

![Wireflow 3](./images/wireflow3.png)

:five: Another option is exploring the mammal sound database. On here, you can click play and pause on each mammal to hear what they sound like. I don't think there's a way to embed sound on Figma currently, so the demonstration only shows the progress bar.

:six: Thirdly, the app allows you to read up on current articles if you are more of a textual person. The user can choose from articles shown on the main screen which then brings up the article. The user can exit using the back arrow.

:seven: Lastly, something that the user can learn about is tracking current coastal clean-up efforts. They can select different machines on the screen to see where it is deployed and what that machine is doing. Some of the popups have linked videos that when clicked on will open a new tab with the video.

:eight: Every home button will take the user back to the home screen.

## Cognitive Walkthrough
During Week 9, I conducted a cognitive walkthrough with two of my peers. The walkthrough lasted about 15 minutes during which, the two classmates gave me their impressions of the start screen and what they thought the app was for. After that, I presented one of my personas⁠—Mickey, the overbooker⁠—and they completed two tasks according the my persona. The task was finding a way to do their part to help support marine conservation efforts amidst having very little time, and find recent information to learn more about what is affecting the ocean.

**Summary Based on Nielson’s Heuristics** 

:one: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

**“It's inviting!” | “ To provide a platform for people to get involved in sustainability efforts” | “I think this app is about learning more about the ocean ecosystem and getting involved with the app with small actionable steps.” | “The design is simplistic and really clean!”**

> They really liked the aesthetic of the app and had the right ideas about what this app is for! This is good to know as I remember that users would not use sites that they found unattractive or did not look reliable. I’m also relieved that the app looks like what it provides what services it does provide.

:two: User Control and Freedom 

**“It's also very clear, but I wish there was a way to go back without going all the way to the front iteration”**

> I did make the app with the assumption that there would be a back button on the phone so I was relying on that for navigation. I could add a navigation bar but I think that that would add some clutter. Because there aren’t many pages to go back and forth between, I will have to make a tradeoff and forgo the navigation bar for the sake of keeping the interface tidy and minimalist. I see greater benefit in keeping the aesthetic clean as it is easier for the user to navigate and prevents them from being overwhelmed. 

:three: Match Between System and Real World

**“Database name is confusing. Grouping recent articles under database is confusing”**

> This was very good to learn as it is an easy fix and I don’t want to confuse users since that would prevent them from achieving their goal. 

:four: Error Prevention

**“There needs to be a notice that clicking a URL will take you to another link.”**

> This was actually one of the errors I remember catching when conducting a heuristic analysis on competitor sites, but I had failed to prevent it in my own product. I definitely will add a warning popup to notify users when they are clicking on a link that will take them to another site. 

From this I made the following revisions:
* added warning popups to any URLs that a user can click on so that they can confirm that they want to leave the site and go to the new link
* changed the name from “Database” to “Learn More”
* added the text "Read Me" to the pictures on the articles to be more understandable

## Reflection

If I could go back and redo this process, I would definitely have wanted to conduct user testing on it. However, I have come to realize that UIUX is about tradeoffs and making the best decision in the moment. I am still proud of my app in the way that it achieves the goals that I had set for it and serves its purpose. The cognitive walkthrough was essential in getting quality feedback from peers who know what to look for. This entire process goes to show how cyclic UI/UX is and that it is a never-ending process of obtaining feedback, getting creative, and then revising the results. With every revision though, the final product does get more and more polished. It's very satisfying to be able to deliver a solution with the customer's best interests at heart.
