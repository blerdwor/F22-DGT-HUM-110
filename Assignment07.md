# Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype

Belle Lerdworatawee | DGT HUM 110 | Fall 2022

## Overview
**Project:** 
> The purpose of this project is to help young adults learn about ocean sustainability and find ways that they can help protect marine life. From conducting interviews and field research, I learned that a sample of young adults in LA feel that climate change can be overwhelming, don’t think that helping out is convenient, and like social aspects. Hence, my design aims to address these concerns by providing a website that makes ocean sustainability seem welcoming and worthwhile. The key tasks that this supports are:
> 1. able to easily find relevant non-textual information on news on topics relating to marine conservation
> 2. able to easily find relevant textual information on news on topics relating to marine conservation
> 3. able to easily find ways to help out both in-person and remotely

**Purpose of Interface Design:**
> The purpose of making this high-fidelity prototype is to allow users to visualize  features that I wanted to add to the Marine Conservation’s webpage in order to improve it. This prototype allows us to conduct primitive usability tests.

**Process:**  
> This prototype started with observations and ideas from user testing. Firstly, the design decisions were chosen from observed desires or problems expressed by young adults during field research and interviews. Afterwards, I created 2 user personas to map out the interactions that I wanted to create and what problems they would solve specifically. Then I made a low-fidelity prototype as well as the design kit for it. I tested both with other users to gain a general impression of if the flow made sense or not, and how aesthetic / accessible was my design. I had initially started with a web app; however I changed it to a mobile app. Hence, I needed to modify my low-fidelity prototype a bit and the design library. With this, I started building the frames for my high-fidelity prototype in Figma. Throughout the process and with feedback that I received, I changed one of the original tasks that I had planned as well as conducted research on what content I included in the prototype.

> I plan to conduct a cognitive walkthrough as well as continue to ask for feedback from users to be able to revise my app as best as possible.
