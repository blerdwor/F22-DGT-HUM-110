# Assignment 02: Usability Evaluation with Users
Belle Lerdworatawee | DGT HUM 110 | Fall 2022

## Purpose of UT
The purpose of User Testing (UT) is to connect the trial product or service with real users and get feedback on it. The feedback enables designers to create more human-centric products and evaluate how well it serves its purpose. Through this testing process, designers can explore their product through a fresh pair of eyes by analyzing their target audience’s behavior when interacting with the product. Specifically, I want to test how useful the Marine Conservation Institute website is for gathering information on marine conservation and how easy it is for finding ways to take action. I tested this by coming up with three scenarios and asking a study participant to try to accomplish tasks in each role. Beforehand, I had prepared the scenarios, a form for collecting the data, the recording software, the website, and the environment for testing.

## Pilot UT Reflection
After conducting a pilot test, I learned that user testing definitely doesn’t go the way that you intend it to. But more importantly, gaining experience as a moderator will prime you to be able to handle these scenarios and still be able to collect useful data. As a moderator, I did my best to provide a smooth experience by coming prepared, practicing my script beforehand, and mentally preparing myself to improvise. However, as I later realized, this does not always work out. I now think that it's really important to find the right participants. It would be easier to conduct studies on people who have done user testing before or are comfortable being watched because they provide more feedback. 
### What went well:
What went well is that I think I was able to create a comfortable environment because the participant felt comfortable enough to ask me to take a break. They also asked me to repeat my question several times whereas I feel like if I were in their position, I wouldn’t ask someone to repeat questions out of my own embarrassment. They also were very enthusiastic to participate in the study which was nice as well. Moreover, I learned that it is very difficult to stay neutral while moderating. I was stuck between giving them hints because that would make the data impure, but sometimes they would give up on the task or were very close to getting it. So I had to try to rein myself in and not interfere, especially because I know that I know how to use the website. 
### What did not go well:
In my opinion, many more things went poorly than well, however, these are better opportunities to learn. What didn’t go as well was that the participant was actually somewhat sleepy during the study and I learned that the study was very boring, which exacerbated the problem. They felt tired when going through the website, and thus weren’t the most focused or attentive to using the website. At some points in time, it felt like they didn’t understand my question or the task at hand even though I tried my best to explain it at a beginner level. So I don’t think the data I collected is very accurate.  Another thing that didn’t go well is that the participant sometimes gave up on the task which I wasn’t prepared to handle. I wasn’t sure whether or not I should egg them to keep going because it could mean that the website was too hard to use or it might just be the participant’s lack of effort. I am unsure. 
### Improvements:
From this session, I will definitely improve the way I approach the studies in the future and try my best to compose myself no matter the situation. I think sometimes my tone might’ve been a little impatient or I talked too quickly. I will make sure to not do that in the future. Also it might be nice to have some incentives with the study to make it less boring like offering snacks or drinks. I would also try to talk with the participant more and ask them to explain their thought process more; this might also help with keeping them awake and collect better data.
