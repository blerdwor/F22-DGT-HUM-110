# Assignment 02: Usability Evaluation with Users
Belle Lerdworatawee | DGT HUM 110 | Fall 2022

## Purpose of UT
The purpose of User Testing is to connect the trial product or service with real users and get feedback on it. The feedback enables designers to create more human-centric products and evaluate how well it serves its purpose. Through this testing process, designers can explore their product through a fresh pair of eyes by analyzing their target audience’s behavior when interacting with the product. Specifically, I want to test how useful the Marine Conservation Institute website is for gathering information on marine conservation and how useful it is for finding ways to take action. These are the goals that my project aims to accomplish. From last week’s heuristic evaluation, I found fault with the user control and freedom, and was wondering whether or not other people were able to navigate the website easily. Another point of concern was recognition rather than recall. The site is on the text-heavy side and so I wondered how quickly users would be able to find specific pieces of information if they needed to think about what keywords would be associated with the desired items. I tested these concerns by coming up with three scenarios and asking a study participant to try to accomplish these tasks. The scenarios asked the user participant to take the role of someone who might use the website, and required specific navigation tasks to let me evaluate how quickly and easily the user can navigate the site. Beforehand, I had prepared the scenarios, a form for collecting the data, the recording software, the website, and the environment for testing.

## Pilot UT Reflection
After conducting a pilot test, I learned that user testing definitely doesn’t go the way that you intend it to. But more importantly, gaining experience as a moderator will prime you to be able to handle these scenarios and still be able to collect useful data. As a moderator, I did my best to provide a smooth experience by coming prepared, practicing my script beforehand, and mentally preparing myself to improvise. My biggest takeaway is that I need to talk slower, and enunciate so that the participant can understand what I want them to do. I had tried explaining the situations as clearly as possible, but I was somewhat nervous and spoke faster than the participant could understand me. I was trying to stay as neutral as possible when I should have adapted to the situation. While I don’t think I heavily influenced the participant’s decisions, I do think that I could have provided more guidance and sounded more confident. This demonstrated the importance of how the moderator conducts themselves as they hold a lot of power over the test subject. It’s a delicate process that only time and experience can hone. 
### What went well:
What went well is that I was able to create a comfortable environment because the participant felt comfortable enough to ask me to take a 15 minute break. They also asked me to repeat the same question several times whereas I feel like if I were in their position, I wouldn’t ask someone to repeat questions out of embarrassment. They also were very enthusiastic to participate in the study. Moreover, the materials were prepared well (eg. checked for typos and such) and I had tested out the recording software prior to the session so the entire process went smoothly. The scenarios that I had prepared were much harder to complete based on the participant’s experience which was surprising to me, but very valuable information.  Moreover, I learned that it is very difficult to stay neutral while moderating. I was stuck between giving them hints because that would make the data impure, but sometimes they would give up on the task or were very close to getting it. So I had to try to rein myself in and not interfere, especially because I know that I know how to use the website. 
### What did not go well:
In my opinion, many more things went poorly than well, however, these are better opportunities to learn. What didn’t go as well was that the participant was actually somewhat sleepy during the study and I learned that the study was very boring, which exacerbated the problem. They felt tired when going through the website, and thus weren’t the most focused or attentive to using the website. At some points in time, it felt like they didn’t understand my question or the task at hand even though I tried my best to explain it at a beginner level. So I don’t think the data I collected is very accurate.  Another thing that didn’t go well is that the participant sometimes gave up on the task which I wasn’t prepared to handle. I wasn’t sure whether or not I should egg them to keep going because it could mean that the website was too hard to use or it might just be the participant’s lack of effort; I am unsure. I could’ve better handled this by asking to reschedule the session or make it more interactive by prompting them to explain their perspective and what they were considering while interacting with the site.
### Improvements:
From this session, I will definitely improve the way I approach the studies in the future and try my best to compose myself no matter the situation. I think sometimes my tone might’ve been a little impatient or I talked too quickly. I will make sure to not do that in the future. Also it might be nice to have some incentives with the study to make it less boring like offering snacks or drinks. I would also try to talk with the participant more and ask them to explain their thought process more; this might also help with keeping them awake and collect better data. Additionally, there is a lot of patience required! I already knew how to complete the tasks and whether or not they were accomplishable. I was slightly impatient or frustrated when the user couldn’t find something or gave up since I had an answer in my mind. I need to step away from the mindset of right or wrong when approaching the tasks, and instead focus on the user and their thought process. I will ask the participant to explain their thought processes more frequently as well as prepare questions beforehand to understand why they’re doing what they are doing.
