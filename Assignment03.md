# Assignment 03: Learning from People in Context 
Belle Lerdworatawee | DGT HUM 110 | Fall 2022

## Description of Project
### :one: Specify the research goal and requirements 
**What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**
> This project aims to help users learn about ocean sustainability and ways to help protect marine life. This will hopefully serve the community by creating more awareness and advocacy for the oceans as LA beaches are known to be hazardous, which harms the marine ecosystem and ultimately us. 

**What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?**
> While not obvious, this fulfills the user’s basic physiological need since all ecosystems are connected. So when one fails, it adversely affects the others. The oceans are responsible for regulating temperature and providing food. Some areas are seeing more immediate consequences of climate change relating to the ocean like bleached coral reefs, unusual storm activity, and plastic in fish.   

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
> Current solutions to combat ocean pollution include neighborhood movements to clean beaches, university efforts to reduce waste, and social media trends of replacing one-use plastics with reusable items like metal straws. Many of these efforts are targeted at users to be more mindful about sustainability.   

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?**
> One large problem of this is that it is hard to convince people to look past convenience and comfort. For instance many users still prefer plastic straws to metal straws because it doesn’t require them to remember to bring the straw, carry it around, or clean it afterwards. However, I believe that added functionality to the Marine Conservation website may help convince users to take more proactive roles in helping the oceans. 

### :two: Target Users
**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)**
> Demographics: young adults between the ages of 30 to 26 roughly  
>
> Preference: users who are interested in sustainability (specifically pertaining to the ocean) but are new to the movement and want to learn about it. Ideally, they would have little to no experience helping the oceans and thus would be actively looking for ways to get involved.  
>
> Expertise: Users should have very little knowledge of life under water, but are curious about it. They should have basic knowledge of how to navigate a website.  
>
> Mainstream vs. Extreme: Mainstream users are those who have the extra time or money to be able to direct towards efforts to conserve and protect the oceans. The more extreme ends are young adults who don’t have those privileges but still want to participate. 

**In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?**
> There are three main uses for the Marine Conservation website. For one, users would use it when they’re trying to learn about what currently is happening to our marine resources, and what this conservation is doing. Additionally, users who are looking to donate, volunteer, intern, or add their research would also use this website to achieve their specific goals to contribute. Lastly, someone who is already actively helping sustain the ocean might want to use the site to promote their activities and reach a wider audience.  

**What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**
> Typically, users can browse news articles and publications on the website to discover more about what’s been happening and what plans organizations have to promote sustainability. There are also pages that offer donation links or volunteer events for users to participate through. For the last activity, I think that the user would need to contact the organization to ask them to add a news article or another page for them.

### :three: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods)
> I decided to use a combination of two methods: participatory research and an interview.

### :four: Plan the details
**Brainstorm the right contexts and narrow down to decide where to visit physically and/or virtually**
> Participatory Research: I will go to the Ralphs in Westwood to observe and ask shoppers questions about reusable bags. While this may not seem connected to my design project, plastic bags are one of the largest pollutants in the oceans. I remember when the state passed a law to charge for plastic bags. They did this out of environmental concerns so I want to observe how people decide whether or not to buy one.

> Interview: I will meet my participant in a quiet office space to have a more authentic experience rather than just the virtual recording. The person I invited to study is a young adult who is not specifically involved with marine conservation. Therefore, they can provide me with insight on how young adults consume information.

**Decide what activities to observe**
> Participatory Research:   
> * Activity 1: I will observe when people buy bags, and arbitrarily ask customers (who seem like they are 26-30 years old) leaving the store why they bought a bag instead of bringing one.  
> * Activity 2: I will observe when people bring bags, and arbitrarily ask customers (who seem like they are 26-30 years old) leaving the store why they brought a bag instead of buying one.  

> Interview: I will observe the participant’s facial expressions, tone, and body language throughout the interview as well how they work with the Internet to complete the tasks. 

**Decide how to interact with the users**
> Participatory: I will observe customers from afar as they’re finishing checking out, and approach some directly to ask questions. 

> Interview: I will just speak with the participant and follow a script to guide the conversation. It should be a more casual conversation. 

**Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images)**
> Participatory Research: I will take pen-paper notes of my observations and the responses that I received. 

> Interview: I will record the conversation and Internet activity via Zoom, and also take handnotes.

**Prepare the (interview + observation) guide**

## Reflection
Reflection

I enjoyed this process a lot more and felt that I received more insight. The interview was more casual and the participant felt more comfortable speaking to me. Although it was a little awkward gathering the information at Ralphs, it felt a little more natural after getting some practice. I found that typically people are nice and are more than happy to answer some questions. I gathered a lot of new information on young adults in general (key insights provided below)! This will be very useful in helping me guide my design project. I learned that some participants have a lot to say (like in my interview) whereas some participants might need more prompting or motivation (as with last week’s user testing). In both cases, it’s important to improvise on the spot. I needed to cut out some of my planned questions because my participant had already answered them by themselves for a previous question. Additionally, my participant shared new sentiments and perspectives that I had not considered before. For instance, I am very willing to give up convenience for more sustainable practices; however I forget that many people do not and we need to meet people where they are. Something that I would do differently next time is to have more confidence when conducting participatory research so that I don’t stutter as much when asking the question. I will also be able to take better notes as I will be more focused on observing the person rather than feeling subconscious about approaching them.
