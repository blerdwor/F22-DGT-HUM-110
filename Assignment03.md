# Assignment 03: Learning from People in Context 
Belle Lerdworatawee | DGT HUM 110 | Fall 2022

## Description of Project
### :one: Specify the research goal and requirements 
**What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**
> This project aims to help users learn about ocean sustainability and ways to help protect marine life. This will hopefully serve the community by creating more awareness and advocacy for the oceans as LA beaches are known to be hazardous, which harms the marine ecosystem and ultimately us. 

**What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?**
> While not obvious, this fulfills the user’s basic physiological need since all ecosystems are connected. So when one fails, it adversely affects the others. The oceans are responsible for regulating temperature and providing food. Some areas are seeing more immediate consequences of climate change relating to the ocean like bleached coral reefs, unusual storm activity, and plastic in fish.   

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
> Current solutions to combat ocean pollution include neighborhood movements to clean beaches, university efforts to reduce waste, and social media trends of replacing one-use plastics with reusable items like metal straws. Many of these efforts are targeted at users to be more mindful about sustainability.   

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?**
> One large problem of this is that it is hard to convince people to look past convenience and comfort. For instance many users still prefer plastic straws to metal straws because it doesn’t require them to remember to bring the straw, carry it around, or clean it afterwards. However, I believe that added functionality to the Marine Conservation website may help convince users to take more proactive roles in helping the oceans. 

### :two: Target Users
**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)**
> Demographics: young adults between the ages of 30 to 26 roughly  
>
> Preference: users who are interested in sustainability (specifically pertaining to the ocean) but are new to the movement and want to learn about it. Ideally, they would have little to no experience helping the oceans and thus would be actively looking for ways to get involved.  
>
> Expertise: Users should have very little knowledge of life under water, but are curious about it. They should have basic knowledge of how to navigate a website.  
>
> Mainstream vs. Extreme: Mainstream users are those who have the extra time or money to be able to direct towards efforts to conserve and protect the oceans. The more extreme ends are young adults who don’t have those privileges but still want to participate. 

**In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?**
> There are three main uses for the Marine Conservation website. For one, users would use it when they’re trying to learn about what currently is happening to our marine resources, and what this conservation is doing. Additionally, users who are looking to donate, volunteer, intern, or add their research would also use this website to achieve their specific goals to contribute. Lastly, someone who is already actively helping sustain the ocean might want to use the site to promote their activities and reach a wider audience.  

**What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**
> Typically, users can browse news articles and publications on the website to discover more about what’s been happening and what plans organizations have to promote sustainability. There are also pages that offer donation links or volunteer events for users to participate through. For the last activity, I think that the user would need to contact the organization to ask them to add a news article or another page for them.

### :three: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods)
> I decided to use a combination of two methods: participatory research and an interview.

### :four: Plan the details
**Brainstorm the right contexts and narrow down to decide where to visit physically and/or virtually**
> Participatory Research: in person, the Westwood Ralphs  
> Interview: in person, this could be conducted virtually but I was able to meet with the student and so decided to have it in person to have a more authentic experience rather than just the virtual, recorded one  

**Decide what activities to observe**
> Participatory Research: 
Activity 1: I observed when people bought bags, if they made any comments, and arbitrarily would ask people why they bought a bag instead of bringing their own one
Activity 2: I  observed when people brought their own bags and arbitrarily chose people to ask why not just buy a bag   
> Interview: in person, I followed this script

**Decide how to interact with the users**
> As mentioned above, both methods involve participation.
> 
**Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images)**
> Participatory Research: I took pen-paper notes of my observations and the responses that I received 
> Interview: I recorded our conversation, as well as took notes on a document.

**Prepare the (interview + observation) guide**
> [Script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y2ErcifAN4cb65jco70WFvExIve2Sg26-qEzzCHR2FI/edit?usp=sharing)
