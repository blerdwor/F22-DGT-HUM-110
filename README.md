# A More Compelling Way for Young-Adults to Learn About Global Goal 14: Life Under the Sea and Take Action

## Belle Lerdworatawee | DGT HUM 110: UI+UX Design | Fall 2022

### Design Statement
Oceans are essential to the existence of humans as we rely on them for food, water, energy, and climate regulation. In spite of this, human activity causes severe damage towards oceanic ecosystems. For our survival, we need to take care of and protect our precious resources. However, before we can even begin to do that, it is important to catch people's attention and spark interest in caring for marine life and our oceans. Then, we can collectively make a difference in ways like controlling pollution and overfishing. Thus, my project aims to utilize design practices and user-research methods to create a user experience that educates and persuades young-adults to care for life under the sea. Young-adults are in an early stage of life where they have time and energy to act upon these issues. Additionally, they are the ones who will have to deal with the implications of a compromised ocean ecosystem as they choose to start families and make other serious life decisions so it's important to persuade them.

### Research
In order to understand current UX issues related to learning about marine conservation, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of two relevant websites: the [DHI Group](https://www.dhigroup.com/) and the [Marine Conservation Institute](https://marine-conservation.org/). Please read more about my heuristic evaluation [here](https://github.com/blerdwor/F22-DGT-HUM-110/blob/main/Assignment01.md). 

I also conducted User Testing on the Marine Conservation Institute. The details of the session may be found [here](https://github.com/blerdwor/F22-DGT-HUM-110/blob/main/Assignment02.md).

### Design
The next step was gathering context and information on young adults, my target audience. So I used two research methods in order to accomplish my goal. The details of my participatory and interview research may be found [here](https://github.com/blerdwor/F22-DGT-HUM-110/blob/main/Assignment03.md).

After conducting research, I had a better idea of my target audience and so created personas to step into the shoes of my audience and better understand their struggles and needs from. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/blerdwor/F22-DGT-HUM-110/blob/main/Assignment04.md).

Finally after I had learned a lot about what young adults find challenging with learning about marine life, I could set off to create a low-fi prototype of my idea to solve this problem. The process and result may be accessed [here](https://github.com/blerdwor/F22-DGT-HUM-110/blob/main/Assignment05.md).
